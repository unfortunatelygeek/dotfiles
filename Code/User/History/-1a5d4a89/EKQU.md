## 🛠️ Tech Stack

We have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in our project.

## 🚀 Installation and Setup

This project is a Myntra clone developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Follow the instructions below to get it up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or any modern web browser
- **Text Editor**: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any editor of your choice

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/myntra-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd myntra-clone
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## 🎨 Features Overview

We have added sections for Sustainability, AR/VR, Weekly challenges, and Social Fashion Feed.

1. 🌿 **Sustainability Section**: Educates users on sustainable fashion practices and promotes eco-friendly brands.

2. 🏆 **Weekly Challenges and Voting**: Users participate in themed fashion challenges, fostering community interaction.

3. 📸 **Fashion Creator Studio Feed**: A dedicated feed for users to showcase their fashion creations.

4. 🕶️ **AR Try-On Experience**: Allows users to virtually try on clothing items using augmented reality.

   ### 👗 Lazy 2D Feature
   The Lazy 2D feature is an innovative addition to our virtual try-on experience. It utilizes Stable VITON (Virtual Try-On) technology to seamlessly fit a person's image with their chosen outfit. Here's how it works:

   - 📸 Users upload a full-body photo of themselves
   - 👚 They select an outfit from our catalog
   - 🖼️ The AI-powered Stable VITON algorithm processes the image and outfit
   - 🎭 The result is a realistic composite image showing the user wearing the selected clothing

   This feature allows users to see how different outfits would look on them without physically trying them on, enhancing the online shopping experience and reducing the need for returns.

   ### 📹 Live Try-On Feature
   The Live Try-On feature takes virtual fitting to the next level with real-time Augmented Reality (AR) technology. This cutting-edge feature offers:

   - 🎥 Real-time clothing overlay on the user's body through their device's camera
   - 🔄 Dynamic adjustment of the virtual clothing as the user moves
   - 👀 Instant visualization of how different outfits look from various angles
   - 💡 Enhanced shopping experience with immediate virtual try-ons

   This AR-powered feature provides an immersive and interactive way for users to explore and experiment with different fashion choices, bridging the gap between online and in-store shopping experiences.

## 💡 Challenges and Learnings

Throughout the development process, we encountered various challenges such as:
- Managing responsive design across multiple devices
- Optimizing performance for complex JavaScript interactions
- Ensuring seamless integration of third-party APIs

These challenges provided valuable learning opportunities in tackling real-world web development issues.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- 👤 Enhanced User Profiles
- 🔍 Advanced Search and Filtering
- 🌐 Social Integration
- 🤖 AI-Powered Recommendations
- 🕶️ Expanded AR Try-On

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the concepts introduced by the Stable VITON project. The stable VITON project aims to create a model that could realistically superimpose clothing items onto a person's image, allowing for a virtual try-on experience. We extend our gratitude to the researchers and developers behind Stable VITON for laying the groundwork that inspired our work.

We would like to express our gratitude to the original creators of this Myntra clone. Special thanks to Md Sahil Amaan and his team for their excellent work on the original clone.
